DESCRIPTION					   *AdvancedMarks-description*

This plugin extends Vim's built-in mark handling. The |:mark| command can only
set lines; with |:SetMarks|, you can also pass a column. |:Delmarks| is an
extension of|:delmarks| that defaults to all marks and can wipe lowercase
marks in all buffers and uppercase marks also from the viminfo file (to keep
them from reappearing after a Vim restart).
If you use marks as bookmarks for interesting areas in a buffer, new commands
let you yank the marked lines (|:YankMarks|) or ranges (|:YankMarkRanges|,
using 'a to 'A, 'b to 'B, and so on). There are variants for ordering the
yanks by marks or lines. A separate |:ReorderMarks| command lets you reorder
messed up marks (e.g. if you forget setting a mark in the middle of a buffer).

SOURCE									     *

- :YankMarks is inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/a/16314609/813602

==============================================================================
USAGE							 *AdvancedMarks-usage*
						       *:SetMarks* *:SetMARKS*
:SetMarks {lnum[:col]} [...]
			Set available lowercase marks to the passed lines [and
			virtual column]. The numbers can be separated by any
			text.
:SetMARKS {lnum[:col]} [...]
			Like |:SetMarks|, but use global uppercase marks.
								   *:Delmarks*
:Delmarks[!]		Delete all named marks a-z (current buffer, with [!]
			in all buffers) and global file marks A-Z (with [!]
			also in the |viminfo| file).
:Delmarks[!] {marks}	Delete {marks}, with [!] lowercase ones in all
			buffers, and uppercase ones also in the |viminfo|
			file.

							       *:ReorderMarks*
:[range]ReorderMarks [{marks}] [{order-expression}]
			Reorder [a-z] / {marks} marks alphabetically / in the
			order of given {marks} / ascending based on the value
			returned by {order-expression} (which is evaluated
			once on each marked line) from begin to end of the
			buffer.

					*:YankMarksByMark* *:YankMarksByLines*
:[range]YankMarksByMark [{marks}] [{register}]
			Yank all marked (with [a-z] / {marks} marks) lines
			into the default register / {register} (in the order
			of the marks, default alphabetically or as given).
:[range]YankMarksByLines [{marks}] [{register}]
			Same as :YankMarksByMark, but yank marks from begin to
			end of the buffer.
			      *:YankMarkRangesByMark* *:YankMarkRangesByLines*
:[range]YankMarkRangesByMark [{marks}] [{register}]
			Yank all ranges of lines that start with a lowercase
			[a-z] / {marks} mark and end with the corresponding
			uppercase [A-Z] mark in the current buffer into the
			default register / {register} (in the order of the
			marks).
:[range]YankMarkRangesByLines [{marks}] [{register}]
			Same as :YankMarkRangesByMark, but yank marks from
			begin to end of the buffer.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					  *AdvancedMarks-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-AdvancedMarks
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AdvancedMarks*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					  *AdvancedMarks-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.038 or
  higher.
- Requires the |ArgsAndMore.vim| plugin (vimscript #4152), version 2.11 or
  higher (only for :Delmarks! deletion in all buffers).

==============================================================================
INTEGRATION					   *AdvancedMarks-integration*

- :ReorderMarks issues a MarksUpdated |User| event. A plugin that displays
  marks (e.g. via signs, like ShowMarks.vim) can be triggered by this to
  update the marks.
